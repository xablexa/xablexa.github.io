                    <h2>5/22/2022 - Adding access to deprecated maps from older projects</h2>
                    <p class="blogTextFull" id="noPicture" href="personalWebsiteProjectBlog5_12_2022.html">
                        The purpose of this blog post is to briefly revisit two old projects that were not linked through my website,
                        but were linked through projects in symposiums that no longer offer access, or were lost to major
                        updates on my website. You can find the links here:

                        <a href="Updated%20Crime%20Map%20Display%20Toggles.html">Plot Map of the Eastern District of Baltimore 2019</a>
                        <br>
                        <a href="leaflet%20neighborhoods%20density%20bins.html">Chloropleth Map of Crime by Baltimore Neighborhood 2019</a>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The first of these maps was developed as a follow-up study to my role on the <a href="personalWebsiteProjects.html" id="projects" type="label">Billie Holiday Project</a>.
                        I wanted to look at the exact same area in Baltimore as our crime map from the 1920's and see how the current
                        day crime data compared to back then. Essentially, I was asking: 'has it gotten any better?' You can toggle
                        through the different types of incidents or click on a dot for a specific type of crime.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The second map is a more general version of this same question. If crime has improved in this neighborhood,
                        does that mean that crime is low everywhere, or just localized to particular places? (considering the history
                        of redling in Baltimore, the hypothesis is that these areas would still be feeling the effects of redlining
                        which were never remedied) Additionally, I also wanted to expand my coding ability in R, specifically for spatial
                        mapping, and this provided a nice challenge to work on these skills. The resulting map shows each neighborhood
                        in Baltimore and the number of incidents divided by the total square miles of that neighborhood. The idea was
                        to get a sense of the density of crime, rather than just the number of crimes in a given area. I could've done
                        this by looking at the population in each neighborhood, but I honestly didn't know how to combine that information
                        at the time (nor did I think to); in the end, both achieve a general sense of density, and land area gives you
                        a better sense of 'how safe am I walking around here?' since it's easier to understand the size of an area than
                        the population for most people.

                        Both of these projects were done using leaflet in R, alongside some other geospatial packages. I would provide my
                        code for these two projects, but the code no longer works and I don't currently feel like revisiting these projects
                        to fix it.
