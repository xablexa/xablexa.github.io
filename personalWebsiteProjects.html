                <p class="projectText">In January of 2019, I joined Dr. Firestone's <a href="https://perception.jhu.edu/">Perception and Mind Lab</a>. I helped Dr. Morales construct
                    a testing aparatus for one of his experiments, and am currently working on my own experiment related to the perception of time. Unfortunately I cannot link any photos
                    yet, but I will as soon as our papers our published! However, please check out all of the other super cool experiments that other members of my lab have done!</p>

                    most of my research was done in various archives that summer, I continue to contribute to the project in the form of maps, which show different crime statistics
                    in the city of Baltimore. The extra contributions I made since working on that project can be viewed through my presentation at the

                <h2>Senior Thesis for English</h2>
                <p class="projectText" id="noPicture">For the Fall semester of my senior year, I will be working on a senior thesis under Dr. Jesse Rosenthal's supervision, a 25-30 page paper to explore any topic of literature that I want.
                I will be analyzing the validity of Computational Literary Studies (CLS) as a concept and its methodology, as well as how CLS might change the field of literature. As a
                psychology major, I have practiced different data-gathering and data-analyzing techniques, which provides me with good background knowledge to investigate how similar
                techniques can be reapplied to traditional literary analysis within the growing trend of Digital Humanities.</p>

                    storytelling, combining my love for English and psychology! Since I work full-time as an Admissions Officer now, 
                I am not able to spend as much time on projects as I did while I was an undergraduate. </p>

                <p class="projectText" id="noPicture">The summer after my first year at JHU, I began working in the Batlab, where I also worked the following fall as well. I helped on two different projects,
                one under the supervision of graduate student Iven Yu, and the other under Dr. Kirsten Bohn. This lab was my first foray into research and data analysis, however
                    I left that lab so that I could shift my research focus to human perception research.</p>

                <p class="projectText">In addition to the projects that I have been lucky enough to help on, I also have a few random projects of my own. These projects are usually small,
                    such as the semi-random number generator I made for assigning to variables in one of my experiments, or a walkthrough that I made to teach my mom
                    how to use Leaflet in R. Other projects are a little bit bigger, like the set of furniture that I made in order to furnish my first real apartment (desktop to the left) or some
                art pieces for my friends.</p>
